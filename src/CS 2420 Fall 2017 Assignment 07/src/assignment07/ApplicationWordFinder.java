/**
 * <p>
 * I wrote a small application to help me find letters for
 * a midterm problem (the tree problem).  I wanted to find
 * an interesting English word that when inserted into a
 * BST, would give English words for each traversal.  I
 * used my SearchTree class to help me search through a list
 * of words.  (It made an OK initial test.)  Ultimately,
 * the test yielded unsatisfactory words, but I evenutally
 * settled on a word that everyone would recognize when they
 * saw it in the post-order traversal.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This was intended to be a throw-away application, but I've
 * decided to put it in the files I give to students.  It's junk
 * but it does use the SearchTree class.
 * </p>
