/**
 * <p>
 * This factory class contains methods for creating objects of some abstract
 * data type. A UtahFactory object has no state (no fields) and no constructor.
 * (The default constructor will be used when a new UtahFactory is created.)
 * Each of the factory methods builds one new object (a data structure and/or
 * one abstract data type), and returns the new object reference to the caller.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To use this class, build a new UtahFactory object, then call the methods to
 * build the objects (to build the data structures / abstract data types). When
 * you make a new UtahFactory object, you'll supply a type parameter. This type
 * parameter will dictate the generic type of the resulting data structures.
 * Create additional factory objects (with different type parameters) if you
 * want different types of data structures.
 * </p>
